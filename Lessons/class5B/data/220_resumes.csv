Due to the growth of Information Technology (IT) and telecommunications sectors in the recent past, the dissemination of alert messages has become prompt and easier. Since the existing business environment faces the challenge of reaching increasingly segmented markets, the design, delivery, and analysis of business communications needs to be tightly    integrated across multiple alert notification channels. Telecommunication channels through which subscribers can receive alert messages may include email, fax, text messaging, instant messaging, broadband network and the like. Due to myriad software applications implemented by businesses and the vast demographics of customers, it may become necessary to segment alert messages so that the messages can be sent through channels based on business needs as well as customer preferences. Further, in order to maintain strong customer relationships, businesses need to time the messages precisely. This brief illustrates how Alert Notification System (IANS) can help organization leverage existing infrastructure to better service their customers.

The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to create an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about how much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational risks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk and capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves appropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.  The New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital requirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage (CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are Simple VaR if the collateral is eligible. If the collateral is ineligible then the Wholesale loan approach will be utilized or the collateral will be reduced to zero in the Simple VaR. .

Company worked for: HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES Duration: From Date: 07 Jun 2004 To Date: 18 May 2007 Designation: SOFTWARE ENGINEER  Client: Huawei China  Project 01: DOPRA  Description of the project DOPRA is the platform for telecom products. It is a proprietary platform and has company internal customers. It has main two planes, system management and system service planes and several sub modules. I have successfully worked on the following modules.  Module - MML INI Parser Tool MML is Configuration Tool used in communication equipments This Configuration Tool has set of default and user defined commands. INI Parsing tool is a tool which accepts MML Commands in certain grammar and generates Resource file and Binary File respectively which will be read by server to resister the commands. Involved in the development, testing, verification of the module on windows.    Module - Man Machine Language MML is a configuration tool widely used in communication equipments. It uses Client/Server architecture. MML server communicates with both the client and the APP in the equipment. It receives MML commands inputted by users from the client and relays it to APP to process it. After acquiring the processing result, the server generates a MML report and sends it back to the client. It interacts with other system modules. Connection Management, Authorization Management, Command Process, Data Synchronization, Event Notification, Command Parsing, LOG/ALARM Handling are some of the functions of MML Server. Involved in the development, defect fixing and verification of the module on windows, Linux and vxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.  Module - Configuration Management Configuration Management Module is core module of System Management. Its main function is to define specifications for configuration management interface between the configuration tool layer and the application layer, and provide related configuration command communication mechanism. Any information that can be modified by the user/application and that affects the functionality of the application can be regarded as configurable data. All configuration commands can be sent to Configuration Management Module using a common interface type. Configuration Data Management Module is a supplementary optional component that can be loaded to provide a persistent storage (&amp; retrieval) mechanism for applications' static configuration data. Involved in the defect fixing and feature enhancement of the module on windows, Linux and vxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.  Module - TL1 Transaction Language 1 (TL1) is a widely used, ""legacy"", management protocol in telecommunications. It is a cross-vendor, cross-technology man-machine language, and is widely used to manage Synchronous Optical Networks (SONET) . It is defined for operation system/ network element (machine-to-machine) interfaces. TL1 corresponds to the User System Language (USL), which is the language for human-to machine interactions. It is used for managing network elements in a network. TL1 Module is an interface between an Application and Client. Client sends the TL1 Commands to perform some configuration operations in the Applications. TL1 module process the client text TL1 commands according to standard specification TL1 GR 831 and interacts with the Configuration management module and Convert Response messages back to TL1 Response messages Involved in development, verification and customer and release activities. I was a module lead for this project.  Module - QX The Qx interface is a company proprietary application layer protocol between target and the GUI of NMS. By this protocol, NE can communicate with SCC (System Communication and Control) software in different operation system. Each command has defined format. Commands are given in binary form. Qx Module acts as an interface between the Client and Application. Involved in development, verification and customer and release activities. I was a module lead for this project.

Wireless stations are connected to form a basic service area which is controlled by a base station called Access Point. Access Point is a special device which basically acts as a bridge between wired and wireless media connected to a distributed system generally Ethernet. Several Access Points can be connected to a distribution media to form an extended service set. In split AP architecture AP's connect to a central controller called Access Controller in short AC. AP has the minimal functionalities such as receiving the 802.11 data from the radio and forwarding data and management frames to AC, Power management, Advertising beacons, handling control frames. Management operations such as Association, Authentication, Handling frames, conversion between [<e2><80><a6>] 802.3 will be done by AC. I was involved in the development of feature development, defect analysis, testing activities in the CLI, Frame handling, Association and Beacon advertisement modules. Module: WLAN Support for WMM 802.11 E Qos Requirements WMM is a protocol designed by the Wi-Fi forum to provide quality of service to wireless traffic. This project basically deals with providing WLAN support for WMM module, this includes handling Qos frames in the Uplink down link data flow, Priority mapping for Qos frames, Fragmentation and Reassembly of the Qos frames, Security Related modifications for Qos Frames, Power management of Qos stations etc. I was involved in the design, review, coding of the Uplink, Down link Data Flow, Fragmentation and Reassembly of the Qos frames.
