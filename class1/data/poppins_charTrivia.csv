"/title/tt0058331/trivia/tr0774065","Originally Walt Disney had considered Mary Martin, Bette Davis and Angela Lansbury for the part of Mary Poppins, based on the cold characterization portrayed in the P.L. Travers books. Walt Disney Pictures (with songwriters Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman and co-writer Don DaGradi acting as the studio's sort-of ""advance"" team) first considered Julie Andrews after seeing her on Ed Sullivan's The Ed Sullivan Show (1948) in January 1961 do excerpts from ""Camelot,"" the show she was appearing in on Broadway. About a month later Walt Disney himself went to New York, caught the show and sounded out Julie backstage after the show (the show was of double interest to Disney because his The Sword in the Stone (1963) animated feature was based on the first book of T.H. White's ""The Once and Future King."" ""Camelot"" was based on the fourth book of the same novel). It was at that February 1961 backstage meeting that Disney first sounded Andrews out, essentially acting out the entire script for her. At the time, her then-husband, Tony Walton, was there with them and Disney asked him about his occupation. He said that he was a costume and set designer. Disney invited Andrews to come to California and asked Walton to bring along his portfolio, so he too found a job with the production. While the film was offered to Andrews, she did not commit until the day after Warner Brothers announced that Audrey Hepburn would be doing My Fair Lady (1964) for them."

"/title/tt0058331/trivia/tr1081693","The old woman in the park Bert talks to in the beginning of the film (with the two tall daughters) is Mrs. Corry. In the book she ran the sweet shop in the park and in the Broadway show this is where they buy the letters to make the word ""supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"". The shop is mentioned once by Mary Poppins in the film before she and the children make a detour to Uncle Albert's house."

"/title/tt0058331/trivia/tr0774015","A sequence known as ""The Magic Compass"", consisting of four songs, was dropped from the film in preproduction. One of those songs, ""The Beautiful Briny"", later resurfaced in Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971).

"/title/tt0058331/trivia/tr0774023","Walt Disney first attempted to purchase the film rights from P.L. Travers as early as 1938. She rejected his offer, as she didn't believe a film version would do justice to her creation. Another reason for her initial rejection would have been that at that time the Disney studios had not yet produced a live-action film."

"/title/tt0058331/trivia/tr0774078","The filmmakers didn't inform Karen Dotrice or Matthew Garber about some ""surprises"" that were going to show up in the movie. Karen's dumbfounded look when Mary Poppins takes out item after item from the carpet bag and her little scream when Mary Poppins gave them medicines of different colors were genuine. The children also weren't told who was acting as Mr. Dawes Sr., and were worried that the horrible old man was going to fall down and die at any moment."
"/title/tt0058331/trivia/tr0774046","Quotes John Keats' ""Endymion"" when Mary Poppins comments ""A thing of beauty is a joy forever,"" as she pulls a potted plant out of her carpet bag. Incidentally, the same quote is used by Gene Wilder in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971)."
"/title/tt0058331/trivia/tr0774085","Lyricist Robert B. Sherman had searched for nearly two weeks for a catchy phrase that could be Mary Poppins' anthem. He came across the perfect title when his young son Jeff came home from school one day and announced that he had just received a polio vaccine. Thinking that the vaccine had been administered as a shot, Sherman asked, ""Did it hurt?"" He replied, ""No. They just gave it to me on a cube of sugar and I swallowed it down."" Sherman tried the idea on his brother the following morning, Richard M. Sherman put the phrase to music and ""A Spoonful of Sugar"" was born."

He also voices the Parrot Umbrella Handle at the end of the movie. Original choices for George Banks included Richard Harris, Terry-Thomas, George Sanders, James Mason and Donald Sutherland."
"/title/tt0058331/trivia/tr0774048","There are 20 distinguishable names in ""Jolly Holiday"" when Bert and the penguins are discussing how no one is better than Mary Poppins.

"/title/tt0058331/trivia/tr0774094","The word ""supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" seems to pre-date the movie, but language experts have yet to pin down by how much, or what exactly, it originally meant. An urban myth is growing that it had something to do with Irish (or Scottish) prostitutes. Its use in the movie may have been inspired by a nonsense word the Sherman brothers (Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman) learned at summer camp. They remembered having a word that the adults didn't know, and thought the Banks children should have one, too."
"/title/tt0058331/trivia/tr0774022","The chorus performing as the animated Pearly Band during ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" was comprised of songwriter Richard M. Sherman, vocal coach J. Pat O'Malley and Julie Andrews."

"/title/tt0058331/trivia/tr0774092","Julie Andrews was determined to nail the lullaby ""Stay Awake"". She took nearly 50 takes (most reports suggest 47) in the Disney recording studio to create the perfect ""soft"" voice quality for the song. Dick Van Dyke, on the other hand, took only one take to record his verses as Mr. Dawes, Sr. on ""Fidelity, Fiduciary Bank""."
"/title/tt0058331/trivia/tr0774026","Danny Kaye, Fred Astaire, Jim Dale and even Cary Grant were briefly considered for the role of Bert. P.L.

"/title/tt0058331/trivia/tr0759194","The planning and composing of the songs took about two-and-a-half years. This was a tremendous amount of work and it was not until the author, P. L.

It was only after the excruciating effort with Travers was completed that she finally signed."

"/title/tt0058331/trivia/tr0774070","Matthew Garber was paid 10 cents for every time they filmed the tea party scene. He was afraid of heights, so somebody offered to pay him a ""bonus"" 10 cents for every take."
"/title/tt0058331/trivia/tr0774031","The character of Bert is actually an amalgamation of several of Mary Poppins' friends from the books. Among them, the minor character of a chimney sweep. It was a drawing of that sweep by one of the animators that inspired the song ""Chim Chim Cheree."""

"/title/tt0058331/trivia/tr0774074","P.L. Travers was a stickler about details in the script, driving many of the Disney writers to distraction about Poppins minutiae. After seeing the final film, she devised a list of changes she wanted. Her requests went unheeded after Walt Disney himself pointed out that although she had script approval, she did NOT have final draft approval. Among the things that she disliked was the score of songwriters Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman.

"/title/tt0058331/trivia/tr1802753","P.L. Travers never forgave Walt Disney for what she saw as a vulgar and disrespectful adaptation of her ""Mary Poppins"" novels. In 1993, 29 years after the release of the film, stage producer Cameron Mackintosh approached Travers about a musical theatre version of her work. She initially refused, citing the film as a reason why she would never again allow an adaptation of her ""Mary Poppins"" series. After several meetings, however, she relented, though when Mackintosh suggested using the songs from the Disney film in the production, Travers again balked. After much more pleading, Mackintosh convinced her to allow a stage production with the songs from the film on the strict proviso that no Americans participate in the development, and further that no one involved with the film version--including original film composers Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman, both of whom were still alive and working at the time--could participate. Mackintosh proceeded with development of the stage adaptation for several years without any involvement from Disney, per Travers' wishes, though after the author's death in 1996 the Walt Disney Company was allowed some degree of creative involvement and went on to co-produce the musical with Mackintosh. The musical would ultimately debut in London's West End in 2004 before opening on Broadway in 2006. It received 7 Tony Award Nominations, including Best Musical."
